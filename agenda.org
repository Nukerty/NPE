* Agenda for 23/11/2021

** TODO Create more efficient way of handling these large databases
+ I have worked out a way to handle in O(n) per file O(nC2) which is much better
than O(n^2) with O(n)
+ Sqlite3 has no providence for pythonic unsafe multithreading
+ Sqlite3 impl without multithreading is extrememly slow
+ Should shift back to the original method
